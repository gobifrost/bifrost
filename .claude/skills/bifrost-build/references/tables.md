# Tables and Policies

Bifrost tables store JSON documents with optional schema hints and row-level policies. Design schema, identity, access, and query patterns together before building UI around a table.

Use `../generated/python-sdk-signatures.md` and `../generated/web-sdk-surface.md` for exact signatures.

## Ownership and creation

- A Solution-owned table is declared in its manifest and changed by deploy.
- A loose table is created/updated with the table CLI.
- Table rows are environment data. Review backup/replacement behavior separately from schema deployment.

New tables normally have only an admin-bypass policy. Ordinary users cannot safely read or write until explicit policies exist. Test policies with realistic non-admin callers and with rows that should and should not match.

Choose stable field names and a durable row-ID strategy. Renaming a table breaks SDK lookups by name; search every app/workflow reference before doing it.

## Python and web operations differ

| Intent | Python workflow SDK | Web app SDK | Important difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert one | `tables.insert(name, data)` | `tables.insert(name, data)` | Similar |
| Insert batch | `tables.insert_batch(name, documents)` | `tables.insert(name, [{data, id?}])` | Different method/item shape |
| Upsert one | `tables.upsert(name, id, data)` | `tables.upsert(name, {id, data})` | Positional ID versus object |
| Update row | `tables.update(name, id, data)` | `tables.update(name, id, data)` | Merge update |
| Delete row | `tables.delete_document(name, id)` | `tables.delete(name, id)` | Different method name |
| Delete rows | `tables.delete_batch(name, ids)` | `tables.delete(name, ids)` | Different method name |
| Delete table | `tables.delete(table_id)` | No app-SDK equivalent | Python `delete` destroys the table |
| Query | keyword arguments | one options object | Return/hook shapes differ |
| Filtered count | `tables.count(name, where=...)` | Not supported | Web count is unfiltered |

### Critical delete trap

In Python, `tables.delete(table_id)` deletes the entire table and its data. Delete a row with `delete_document`; delete rows with `delete_batch`.

In the web SDK, `tables.delete(table, idOrIds)` deletes rows and never the table.

Resolve the table and intended row IDs before destructive calls. Add a test that would fail if the wrong object were deleted.

## Python result shape

Python returns models with attribute access:

```python
from bifrost import tables

result = await tables.query(
    "tickets",
    where={"status": "open"},
    order_by="created_at",
    order_dir="desc",
    limit=50,
)

for document in result.documents:
    print(document.id, document.data.get("title"))
```

Use `document.id`, `document.data`, and `result.documents`/`result.total`. Do not subscript `DocumentData` or `DocumentList` as dictionaries.

## Web result shape

Imperative `tables.query()` returns documents with fields nested under `.data`. React `useTable` and `useInfiniteTable` return flattened rows: custom data fields and metadata such as `id` are at the row's top level.

```tsx
import { useTable } from "bifrost";

const { rows, total, loading, error } = useTable("tickets", {
  where: { status: "open" },
  page: 1,
  pageSize: 25,
  order_by: "created_at",
  order_dir: "desc",
});

const firstTitle = rows[0]?.title;
```

Render loading, empty, error, access-denied, and pagination states. Live inserts outside the current page can remain outside the visible window; do not imply that every realtime event appears on the current page.

## Filter DSL

Both SDKs use field-keyed filters. Common operators are `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `is_null`, `has_key`, `contains`, `starts_with`, and `ends_with`.

- Python commonly uses `in_`; TypeScript uses `in`.
- Do not use `ilike`; it is not a valid filter and can be ignored. Use `contains` for case-insensitive substring matching.
- `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `has_key` work in one-shot queries but not in `useTable` live-subscription filters. Use an imperative query when those operators are required.

Test filtering with nulls, types, pagination, ordering ties, and values containing punctuation or mixed case.

## Errors and permissions

Missing rows normally return `None`/`null`; missing tables and denied access may raise surface-specific errors. In the browser, handle `TableNotFoundError` and `TableAccessDeniedError` distinctly when the user can act differently.

Do not treat an empty Python `tables.query()` as proof that a shared table exists: Solution lookup can convert some missing-table reads into an empty list. Validate setup when absence would be an error.

## Solution scope and shared fallback

Solution context resolves its own table first. With `global_repo_access: true`, a miss may fall back by name to an eligible install-org and then global loose table. Shared fallback tables are read-only from the Solution; the flag does not permit row mutation outside the install. Policies still apply after resolution.

Prefer Solution-owned tables for portable features. If relying on a shared table, document the dependency and test local preview and deployed behavior. Read `solution-resource-access.md` for the exact matrix.

## Verification checklist

- Confirm owner, scope, stable name, schema, and ID strategy.
- Verify policies with allowed and denied non-admin callers.
- Test insert, query, update, row delete, empty results, malformed data, and concurrency as relevant.
- Verify web flattened rows versus imperative/Python nested rows.
- Confirm live updates, pagination, and long-content rendering in the app.
- Back up or explicitly approve any destructive schema/table/data operation.
