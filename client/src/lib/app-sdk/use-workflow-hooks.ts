/**
 * `useWorkflowQuery` / `useWorkflowMutation` — the v2 SDK's PRIMARY workflow
 * hooks, shaped after React Query (which every developer — and every LLM — knows
 * cold). They make the read-vs-write intent explicit at the call site:
 *
 *   - **useWorkflowQuery(ref, params?)** — a READ. Auto-runs on mount, re-runs
 *     when the ref/params change, and exposes `refresh()`. Use for "load this
 *     data when the component shows" (`{ data, loading, error, refresh }`).
 *   - **useWorkflowMutation(ref)** — a WRITE/ACTION. Does NOT run on mount; you
 *     call `mutate(input)` from an event handler (`{ mutate, data, loading,
 *     error }`).
 *
 * Why these are primary, not the lower-level `useWorkflow`: `useWorkflow` returns
 * `data` but never runs until you call `run()`, so `const { data } = useWorkflow(...)`
 * silently stays null — a trap. The query/mutation split removes that ambiguity.
 * Both are thin wrappers over `useWorkflow`, so they share its auth/transport,
 * `app_id` scoping, and stale-run guarding. `useWorkflow` remains exported as the
 * low-level escape hatch.
