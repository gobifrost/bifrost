# Import/Export Dead-Code Map + Write-Contract Unification

**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Branch investigated:** `origin/main` @ `9a76c95c` (Solutions PR #347 merged 2026-06-17)
**Status:** Deep-dive findings + proposed design — awaiting approval before any refactor

> ⚠️ Scope note: the primary `bifrost` checkout was 29 commits behind `origin/main` and
> predated the Solutions merge. All findings here are verified against a fresh worktree off
> `origin/main`. Anything claimed about "old main" elsewhere is stale.

## 1. The question

After the Solutions work merged, Jack expected the old import/export system to be
deprecated, but noticed (a) manifest/Solutions writes don't follow the same API contract
rules as the REST routers (POST-vs-PATCH decided by bespoke logic), and (b) concrete field
drops — agent **tool description** not carried forward, and agent **name** behaving
differently in Solutions than elsewhere. Before unifying the write contracts, he wants to
know **what is actually dead** so we don't refactor unused code.

---

## 2. Dead-code map (verified, with evidence)

### 2.1 Already deleted (clean — no orphan references)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `api/bifrost/commands/export.py` (`bifrost export`) | **GONE** | File absent; no importer anywhere |
| `api/bifrost/commands/import_cmd.py` (`bifrost import`) | **GONE** | File absent; no importer |
| `api/bifrost/portable.py` (scrub pipeline) | **GONE** | File absent; no importer |

The portable CLI bundle story (`bifrost export --portable` / `bifrost import`) is **already
removed**. Don't resurrect or refactor it.

### 2.2 Live — keep

| Item | Status | Live caller |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest_generator.py` (`generate_manifest`, `serialize_*`) | **LIVE** | git-sync, `entity_change_hook` (CLI watch), `solutions/capture.py` |
| `manifest_import.py` (`import_manifest_from_repo`, `ManifestResolver`, `_*_content_from_manifest`) | **LIVE** | git-sync reconciliation; **Solutions deploy** reuses the content-builder helpers |
| `github_sync.py` | **LIVE** | scheduler background sync jobs |
| `AgentIndexer` / `FormIndexer` | **LIVE** | git-sync **and** Solutions deploy both delegate here |
| `solutions/*` (deploy, capture, guard, export, git_sync, integration_template) | **LIVE** | the Solutions feature |

### 2.3 Live UI feature — separate system, NOT the manifest path

`api/src/routers/export_import.py` → `/api/export-import/*` (export/import of **knowledge,
configs, tables, integrations, "all"-zip**). **LIVE**, called from `client/src/services/exportImport.ts`
(Knowledge, Config, Tables, Integrations, Maintenance pages + ImportDialog).

This is a **third** system, distinct from both the manifest path and Solutions. It is a
per-entity JSON/ZIP backup-and-restore for the *operator's own* environment, with its own
secret re-encryption (`encrypt_secret`/`decrypt_with_key`) and org rebinding.

**Redundancy evaluation (Jack asked for this):**

- **Overlap with Solutions is substantial.** Solutions capture/export already handles **tables
  incl. row data** (`capture.py` `include_data`, per-table row cap at `capture.py:78`,
  `Document` rows), **configs incl. secrets** (decrypt → `secrets.enc` blob via
  `secrets_blob.py`), and **integrations** (secret-scrubbed templates). So
  `/api/export-import/{tables,configs,integrations}` re-implements capabilities Solutions now
  has — including a **second independent copy of the secret-encrypt + org-rebind logic**.
- **Knowledge is NOT covered by Solutions.** Solutions only carries agent `knowledge_sources`
  *references*, never `KnowledgeStore` contents. `/api/export-import/knowledge` has **no
  Solutions equivalent** and must survive regardless.
- **They are not wired together.** `solutions.py` imports only `solutions.export.build_workspace_zip`;
  it never touches the `export_import` router. Parallel implementations, not shared code.
  > `[corrected 2026-06-19]` "second independent copy of the secret-encrypt logic" **overstates
  > it.** They are *parallel re-implementations sharing only `src.core.security` primitives*, not
  > a literal copy: export-import re-encrypts source-key→dest-key (`export_import.py:729-730`),
  > Solutions uses a scrypt password envelope (`secrets_blob.py`). Overlap is on *entity
  > coverage*, not orchestration. (Verified §7.)
- **Verdict:** `/api/export-import` is a *fourth* parallel write/field-mapping system and a
  *second* secret-handling implementation. Tables/configs/integrations there are largely
  redundant with Solutions for *distribution*, but the router still serves an *operator
  self-backup* use case (export your own env to JSON, re-import later) that Solutions'
  package-centric model doesn't directly replace — and Knowledge pins it alive. Recommendation:
  **keep for now, do not fold into this effort**, but flag it as the next consolidation
  candidate once contract-unification (below) proves the pattern — at minimum its
  tables/configs/integrations field mapping and secret handling should eventually route through
  the same source of truth rather than a fifth bespoke copy.

### 2.4 Likely-orphaned endpoint (flag, don't delete yet)

`POST /api/files/manifest/import` (`files.py:457`): now that the CLI `import` command is
deleted, **no external caller remains** — it appears only in generated `client/src/lib/v1.d.ts`,
with no `client/src` fetch and no `api/bifrost` caller. The only non-test caller is the router
handler itself, which calls `import_manifest_from_repo` (`files.py:493`). So the *endpoint
wrapper* is orphaned even though `GET /api/files/manifest` is still used (CLI watch / git-sync
state export). **Classification: unclear-leaning-dead; verify with a request-log check before
removing.**

> `[corrected 2026-06-19]` Earlier this section said "git-sync calls `import_manifest_from_repo`
> directly." **That is wrong.** git-sync bypasses *both* the HTTP wrapper **and**
> `import_manifest_from_repo` — it instantiates `ManifestResolver` directly
> (`github_sync.py:54-56,279`) and drives `_diff_and_collect` (`:1146`). The two import paths
> share only the `ManifestResolver` class, not that function. The endpoint is still orphaned —
> just for a different reason than originally stated. (Verified §7.)

## 3. How many "decide POST vs PATCH" systems exist

This is the heart of Jack's concern. Counting distinct create-vs-update mechanisms across the
codebase for the **overlapping** entities (agents, forms, tables, configs, apps, integrations,
workflows, events):

1. **REST routers** — HTTP verb decides. `POST` = insert (new UUID), `PUT/PATCH` = update by
   id. Pydantic DTO validation up front (`AgentCreate.name` is `min_length=1`, etc.). Writes
   via ORM constructor / setters (agents, forms) or a repository (tables, configs, apps).
2. **Manifest import — `Upsert(match_on="id")`** (`sync_ops.py`). Used for agents (metadata),
   forms (metadata), apps, configs, workflows, claims, config-schemas. SELECT-by-id →
   UPDATE-or-INSERT.
3. **Manifest import — natural-key two-pass** (`_resolve_table`, `_resolve_custom_claim`,
   `_resolve_workflow`, `_resolve_integration`): try `(name|path, org)` → realign id → else id
   → else insert. Exists because portable bundles carry different UUIDs across environments.
4. **Direct `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`** — event sources/subscriptions, table insert, integration
   nested rows (config schema, oauth provider, mappings). Executed immediately, not deferred.
5. **Indexer `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`** — `AgentIndexer.index_agent`, `FormIndexer.index_form`.
   This is where agents/forms *content* (description, channels, tools, schema) actually lands,
   for **both** git-sync and Solutions deploy.
6. **Solutions deploy** adds two *installation-level* gates on top of #2/#5: per-install
   `uuid5` id remap + an **ownership guard** (`guard.py` / `_guard_owner`: a row's `solution_id`
   must be NULL or this install) + scoped full-replace deletion (`WHERE solution_id = sid AND
   id NOT IN bundle`). These are legitimately Solutions-specific and should **not** be unified
   away — they enforce the one-writer-per-install invariant git-sync doesn't need.

**So: ~5 create-vs-update implementations for the same entities** (6 counting Solutions'
overlay), three of which (#2, #3, #5) live inside `manifest_import.py` alone. The REST contract
(#1) is a separate sixth that the others were supposed to mirror but drifted from.

## 4. The actual field divergences (Jack's two bugs, root-caused)

The earlier sub-agent reports disagreed; I read the code to settle it. **Both** the
"description is lost" claim and the "no divergence at all" claim were wrong. Reality:

Agents flow through **two write stages** in the manifest/Solutions path:
`ManifestAgent` → `_agent_content_from_manifest()` (YAML) → `AgentIndexer.index_agent()`
(content: name, description, system_prompt, channels, knowledge_sources, system_tools,
llm_model, llm_max_tokens, tools, delegations) → then deploy stamps scope + `max_iterations` /
`max_token_budget` / `mcp_connection_ids`. So description/channels/tools **do** round-trip.
The `_resolve_agent` `Upsert` is metadata-only and runs *alongside* the indexer, not instead
of it — that's what confused the static reads.

### 4.1 Tool description — REAL end-to-end drop (Jack's bug #1) ✅ confirmed

- A tool's LLM-facing description is `Workflow.tool_description` (`workflows.py:91`), **not** an
  agent field. The agent only stores `tool_ids` (workflow UUID bindings).
- `tool_description` is set **only** via the REST/UI workflow path (`workflows.py:1581-1582`).
  The workflow indexer comment is explicit: *"tool_description ... are API/UI-only — never set
  from code."* (`indexers/workflow.py:190`).
- **`tool_description` is absent from `ManifestWorkflow`, from `manifest_generator` (export),
  from `manifest_import` (import), and from Solutions deploy.** Grep returns zero hits in all
  four.
- **Consequence:** capture a solution → deploy it → every tool reverts to the workflow's plain
  `description`; the curated `tool_description` is silently gone. This is a true contract
  divergence: REST carries the field, the portable/manifest/Solutions chain drops it across the
  board. It is *not* a deploy-vs-REST bug — it's a missing field in the manifest model and its
  serializer/deserializer.

### 4.2 Agent name — REAL behavioral divergence (Jack's bug #2) ✅ confirmed

- REST: `AgentCreate.name` / `AgentUpdate.name` are `Field(min_length=1, max_length=255)` —
  empty/missing name → **422, hard fail** (`contracts/agents.py:56,85`).
- Manifest/Solutions: `_agent_content_from_manifest` emits `name = magent.name or ""`
  (manifest_import.py:295); `AgentIndexer.index_agent` then **silently returns `False` (no DB
  write at all) if name is missing** (`agent.py:70-72`), and otherwise will happily write an
  empty/odd name with **no length/format validation**. The indexer also accepts `tools` as an
  alias for `tool_ids` (`agent.py:153`) — another input shape the REST DTO doesn't have.
- **Consequence:** the same logical agent validates and errors differently depending on which
  door it comes through. That's the "name doesn't work the same in Solutions" symptom.

### 4.3 Other drifts found (same root cause: bespoke writers, not the DTO)

- **Forms (manifest `_resolve_form` metadata Upsert):** sets only name/is_active/created_by/
  org/access_level; relies on `FormIndexer` for description/workflow_id/schema. Workflow
  binding correctness therefore depends on the indexer + inline content being complete, not on
  the `FormCreate` contract.
- **Apps:** manifest defaults `app_model` to `inline_v1`; REST defaults to `standalone_v2`.
  `created_by` "git-sync" vs `user.email`. `icon` not carried by manifest.
- **created_by / timestamps:** manifest paths stamp synthetic `git-sync` / `file_sync` /
  `solution-deploy` and bypass the router's `now`. Mostly cosmetic, but it means audit columns
  mean different things depending on the writer.

---

## 5. What this implies (and what it does *not*)

- The portable-CLI half of the "old system" is **already dead and removed** — no refactor debt
  there.
- The manifest/git-sync core and the `/api/export-import` UI feature are both **live**; neither
  is safe to delete.
- The genuine problem is exactly as Jack framed it: **the write paths don't share the API
  contract.** Multiple bespoke create-vs-update implementations (#2–#5) each re-decide field
  mapping, so fields the REST DTO carries (`tool_description`, name validation, `icon`, form
  workflow binding) drift or drop. Unifying these reduces six decision points toward one source
  of truth and makes the two reported bugs structurally impossible rather than individually
  patched.

---

## 6. Proposed direction (contract unification) — to discuss before planning

**Goal:** all entity writes — REST, git-sync/manifest import, Solutions deploy — agree on
*what fields an entity has* and *how create-vs-update is decided*, by routing through one
contract layer, while preserving the legitimately-distinct concerns (portability id-remap,
Solutions ownership/scope guards).

Three candidate shapes, in increasing ambition:

- **A — Close the specific gaps only (minimal).** Add `tool_description` to `ManifestWorkflow` +
  generator + importer; make `AgentIndexer` validate name like the DTO (reject empty, enforce
  length) instead of silent no-op; align app defaults. Fixes both reported bugs and the worst
  drifts. Does **not** unify the mechanisms — the N writers remain, just better aligned. Lowest
  risk, leaves the structural problem.

- **B — One field-mapping source of truth (recommended).** Make the manifest models and the
  indexers derive their field set from the same `XxxCreate/XxxUpdate` DTOs (the project already
  has `dto_flags.py` enforcing CLI/MCP parity against these DTOs — extend that discipline to
  manifest + indexer). Keep the *upsert mechanics* per-context (REST verb, manifest id-upsert,
  Solutions overlay) but make them all populate the **same validated field set**. A parity test
  fails when a DTO field isn't carried by the manifest/indexer path. This kills the whole class
  of "field X drops in distribution" bugs without collapsing the upsert strategies that
  legitimately differ.

- **C — Single write-service per entity (most ambitious).** Every door (router, manifest,
  deploy) calls one `EntityService.upsert(dto, *, mode)` that owns validation + field mapping +
  insert/update, with mode-specific hooks for id-remap/ownership. Cleanest end state, largest
  blast radius, touches the most live code.

### 6.1 DECISION (revised 2026-06-19): approach **C — single write-service per entity**

> Supersedes the 2026-06-18 "B with A first" decision. After the live repro (§8) proved both
> bugs are the same root cause — a writer that bypasses the contract — Jack's directive is:
> **"everything should call the same stuff. If manifest needs to do something special like
> resolve by name that's one thing, but it should always use common contracts."** That is
> approach **C**, with a discipline that keeps it from becoming a rewrite.

**The model: one write-core per entity; identity & resolution are caller-supplied parameters.**

For each overlapping entity (agent, form, workflow, app, table, config, integration) there is
exactly one write function — call it `EntityWriter.upsert(content_dto, *, identity, resolution)`:

- **`content_dto`** — the validated portable contract (the existing `XxxCreate`/`XxxUpdate`
  field set). This is the SINGLE source of truth for *what fields exist, validation rules
  (name min_length, etc.), defaults, and field→column mapping*. No caller may skip it or carry
  a different field set. `tool_description` lives here, so every door carries it; a blank name
  fails validation here, so every door rejects it. **This is the layer that makes both bugs
  structurally impossible.**
- **`identity`** — org_id / access_level / owner / created_by, supplied BY THE CALLER. The
  portable content intentionally excludes identity (manifest scrubs it; `bifrost.solution.yaml`
  / the deploy command / the REST request supplies it). This formalizes the existing
  "portable content carries no env-specific fields" rule — see CLAUDE.md "portability design".
- **`resolution`** — the pluggable strategy for *which row* and create-vs-update:
  `by_id` (REST PUT), `by_natural_key_realign` (manifest cross-env), `per_install_remap`
  (Solutions uuid5 + ownership guard). This is the "something special" Jack carved out — it's a
  strategy object, NOT a license to hand-roll a separate write. The 8 mechanisms in §7 collapse
  to: ONE writer + a small set of named resolution strategies.
- **Side-effects are shared and unskippable** — role-sync (`sync_*_roles_to_workflows`), tool
  binding, delegation sync run inside the write-core. The MCP bug (drops role-sync) and the
  manifest drifts disappear because no caller can forget a side-effect the core owns.

**Callers after unification:**
- REST routers → `upsert(dto, identity=request, resolution=by_id)` (POST allocates id).
- git-sync / manifest import → `upsert(dto, identity=manifest-entry-scope, resolution=by_natural_key_realign)`.
- Solutions deploy → `upsert(dto, identity=solution-scope, resolution=per_install_remap)` — the
  ownership/scope guard (`guard.py`) and full-replace reconciliation stay as a deploy-level
  wrapper AROUND the write-core, not inside it.
- MCP tools → `upsert(dto, identity=caller-org, resolution=by_id)` — **IN SCOPE** (Jack's call):
  this removes the direct-ORM writes, the hand-rolled name validation, and the dropped role-sync.

**Scope (in):** agents, forms, workflows, apps, tables, configs, integrations — across REST,
manifest/git-sync, Solutions deploy, MCP.
**Scope (out):** `/api/export-import` (operator backup; Knowledge pins it alive — §2.3) and the
Solutions ownership-guard / reconciliation logic (legitimately deploy-specific; wraps the core).

**Sequencing (so the bugs are fixed early and the refactor lands safely):**
1. **Increment 1 — fix the two bugs + add the third's guard** directly (tool_description into the
   manifest/workflow serialization; name validation in the indexer; make blank-name a hard error
   not a silent no-op + fix the lying `agents_upserted` count). Ships value immediately.
2. **Increment 2 — stand up `EntityWriter` for one entity (agent)** and route all four doors
   through it; add a parity test that fails if any door carries a field set diverging from the
   DTO. Agent is the highest-signal (both bugs + MCP divergence live there).
3. **Increment 3..N — migrate remaining entities** one at a time behind the same parity test,
   deleting each bespoke writer as its entity moves over.

### 6.2 Remaining open question (one)
- OK to remove the orphaned `POST /api/files/manifest/import` endpoint wrapper (keeping the
  live `import_manifest_from_repo` service function), pending a prod request-log confirmation
  that nothing external hits it?

### Surface 3b — `POST /api/files/manifest/import` (orphaned wrapper)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE-but-orphaned (no external caller) |
| UI entry | NONE — `v1.d.ts:2696/2709` are generated types only; no client fetch |
| Endpoint | `POST /api/files/manifest/import` (`routers/files.py:457`, `CurrentSuperuser`) |
| Service | Calls `import_manifest_from_repo` (`manifest_import.py:524`, instantiates `ManifestResolver` `:645`) at `files.py:493`, commits `:509` |
| Note | No CLI caller (`api/bifrost/` grep empty). Only non-test caller is the router handler. git-sync does **not** route through this; it uses `ManifestResolver` directly. `test_watch_regression_disappearing_entity.py:253-255` asserts watch must never call it |

### Surface 4 — `/api/export-import/*` (operator backup)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE |
| UI entry | Export: `Knowledge.tsx:295`, `Config.tsx:169`, `Tables.tsx:172`, `Integrations.tsx:135`, `Maintenance.tsx:242`. Import: `ImportDialog.tsx:367,380,387` (rendered from all five pages) |
| Endpoint | `POST /api/export-import/export/{type|all}` + `/import/{type|all}` (`exportImport.ts:31,59,99,131`), all `CurrentSuperuser` |
| Service | Self-contained in `export_import.py` (no service/repository layer). Builders `_build_*_export:165/194/226/271`; helpers `_resolve_org_id:87`, `_parse_target_org:145`. Crypto from `src.core.security` |
| DB write | Direct ORM, bypasses OrgScopedRepository: Knowledge `db.add(KnowledgeStore)` `:568` (embedding `[0.0]*1536`); Tables `db.add(Table, access=make_seed_admin_bypass())` `:663`; Configs `db.add(Config)` `:781`; Integrations `db.add(Integration/ConfigSchema/Mapping/OAuthProvider)` `:868/890/929/1192` |
| Entities | KnowledgeStore, Table, Document, Config, Integration(+ConfigSchema/Mapping), OAuthProvider |
| Create vs update | Natural-key lookup → update-if-found / insert-if-absent. Knowledge (namespace,key,org) `:545`; Tables (name,org) `:620`; Configs (key,org[,integ]) `:755`; Integrations (name, not-deleted) `:835`. `import_all` is delete-free upsert |

### Surface 5 (additional, gap chase) — MCP tools (direct-ORM for 4 of 7 entities)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE — all 16 modules registered (`mcp_server/tools/__init__.py:26-49`) |
| UI entry | MCP client (agent tool calls), not the web UI |
| Endpoint | MCP tools, not HTTP routes. Split: **direct-ORM** (agents/forms/tables/apps create+update) vs **thin REST** (`call_rest`) for configs/integrations/workflow |
| Service | Direct: `agents.create_agent` `db.add(agent)` `agents.py:322`, `db.add(AgentTool)` `:339`, `db.add(AgentDelegation)` `:362`; update setters `:504-522`. `forms.create_form` `db.add(form)` `:308` + `db.add(field)` `:314`. `tables.py:288-289`. `apps.create_application` `db.add(app)` `:188` + `:238 commit`. Thin: configs `:132/181/214`, integrations `:187/247/306/371`, workflow `:505/548/600/646`, `apps.replace_app` `:519` |
| DB write | Direct `db.add(...)` / inline ORM setters (above). **Drops the `sync_*_roles_to_workflows` side-effect** the REST routers run |
| Entities | Agent(+junctions), Form(+FormField), Table, Application — plus configs/integrations/workflow via REST |
| Create vs update | Hand-rolled. `create_agent` validates name itself: `agents.py:260 if not name`, `:264 if len(name)>255` — a reimplementation of the `AgentCreate` Pydantic 422 that can drift |

### Surface 6 (additional, gap chase) — file-write / watch indexing (UPDATE-ONLY)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE via `POST /api/files/write` + `PUT /api/files/editor/content` / watch push |
| UI entry | CLI `bifrost files write` / SDK `files.write` (`bifrost/files.py:137-140`); editor content PUT |
| Endpoint | `POST /api/files/write` (`routers/files.py:215 backend.write`) → `S3Backend.write` (`file_backend.py:178`, only when `location=="workspace"`) → `FileStorageService.write_file` → `_index_python_file_full` → `index_python_file` (`service.py:450,473`); `PUT /api/files/editor/content` `files.py:763` |
| Service | `WorkflowIndexer.index_python_file` (`indexers/workflow.py`) |
| DB write | **UPDATE-ONLY.** Every branch looks up `(path, function_name, solution_id IS NULL)` and skips if absent: `@workflow` `:161-168` (`if not existing_workflow: continue` "Use register_workflow() to register"), `@data_provider` `:281-287`. Mutations are `update(Workflow).where(...)` `:228-233,327-329,632-643`. **No `db.add`/`insert(Workflow)` anywhere in the file.** On file delete, soft-deactivate (`delete_workflows_for_file` `:613-648`, UPDATE not DELETE) |
| Entities | Workflow (update/enrich + soft-delete only) |
| Create vs update | UPDATE only — never creates. Excludes `tool_description` (`:187-190`, "API/UI-only — never set from code"); name/description set only when DB field is NULL (`:207-212`). Gated by `needs_indexing`, set only for `.py` paths (`file_ops.py:215,223,244`; signal at `files.py:858`) |

### Surface 7 (additional, gap chase) — app dependencies / publish

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE |
| UI entry | App builder; MCP `update_app_dependencies`; CLI `bifrost apps set-deps` (`commands/apps.py:17`) |
| Endpoint | `PUT /api/applications/{id}/dependencies` (`app_code_files.py:862-908`, **not** `applications.py`); draft/publish: `applications.py:485` save_draft, `:528` publish, `:629` swap_slugs, `:897` rollback |
| DB write | `put_dependencies` `app.dependencies = deps if deps else None` `:901`, `commit` `:902`, render-cache invalidate `:905-906`; solution guard `:880` |
| Entities | Application (dependencies + compiled-preview/draft state) |
| Create vs update | Update of an existing Application row |

### Surface 8 (additional, gap chase) — CLI

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Live? | LIVE, but pure REST wrapper |
| UI entry | CLI commands |
| Endpoint | Each command maps to a REST verb (`commands/apps.py:6-19`: `create → POST /api/applications`, `set-deps → PUT .../dependencies`; `bifrost/files.py:137 → POST /api/files/write`) |
| DB write | None independent — subsumed by REST contract baseline |
| Create vs update | Same as REST. `bifrost apps create` is a two-step (`POST /api/applications` then optional `PUT .../dependencies`), both REST |

## Spec claims — adjudicated

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence | Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| REST `AgentCreate.name` `min_length=1` → empty/missing returns 422 | **CONFIRMED** | `contracts/agents.py:54-56` `name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=255)`; bound at `routers/agents.py:338-340` | — |
| REST agent path does not set `Workflow.tool_description`; set only via workflow path `workflows.py:1581-1582` | **CONFIRMED** | `routers/agents.py` has only two read-only refs (`:542`, `:1015`); contracts file has zero `tool_description`; only write is `update_workflow` `workflows.py:1580-1582` | — |
| Solutions deploy carries agent description/channels/tools/knowledge_sources via AgentIndexer (NOT lost) | **CONFIRMED** | Emitted `manifest_import.py:296-307`; persisted `agent.py:122/136` (desc), `:124/138` (channels), `:156-174` (tool FKs), `:125/139` (knowledge_sources); `ManifestAgent` fields `manifest.py:160-165` | — |
| Solutions deploy/capture drops `Workflow.tool_description` end-to-end | **CONFIRMED** | Column exists `orm/workflows.py:91` but absent from capture `capture.py:392-407`, `ManifestWorkflow` `manifest.py:81-100`, importer (grep zero), deploy values `deploy.py:778-797` | — |
| Solutions agent name routes through AgentIndexer which silently no-ops on missing name with no length validation (unlike REST 422) | **CONFIRMED** | `agent.py:69-72` `if not name: logger.warning(...); return False` (no exception, no row); no length check in `:119-149`; REST enforces via `contracts/agents.py:56,85` | — |
| `POST /api/files/manifest/import` has no remaining external caller (CLI deleted; github_sync calls `import_manifest_from_repo` directly) | **PARTIAL** | No-caller part CONFIRMED (`v1.d.ts:2696/2709` types only; CLI grep empty; only caller is the router handler `files.py:457-458` → `:493`). Reason REFUTED: github_sync imports `ManifestResolver` directly (`github_sync.py:54-56,279`) + `_diff_and_collect` `:1146`; it never calls `import_manifest_from_repo` | **Fix the spec's parenthetical:** git-sync bypasses BOTH the wrapper AND `import_manifest_from_repo`; the two import paths share only the `ManifestResolver` class, not that function |
| Manifest/git-sync agent path DOES round-trip `description` (earlier "description is lost" claim WRONG) | **CONFIRMED** | `manifest_import.py:293-297` → `_resolve_agent_content:343-353` → `_index_agents_from_manifest:1252-1270` → `agent.py:122/136`; git-sync reaches it via `github_sync.py:1132,1232`; column `orm/agents.py:34`. Caveat: the `_resolve_agent` metadata SyncOp (`:2906`) does NOT write description — it flows only through the indexer side-effect | — |
| ~5-6 distinct create-vs-update impls across REST + manifest_import + Solutions | **CONFIRMED** | Six mechanisms verified (see inventory below): SyncOp.Upsert (`sync_ops.py:103-115`), natural-key two-pass (`manifest_import.py:2390-2452`), insert().on_conflict_do_update (`agent.py:119-148`, `manifest_import.py:2111`), in-place attr-mutation (`manifest_import.py:2069-2087`), REST inline ORM (`agents.py:339`), Solutions overlay (`deploy.py:1268-1325`) | — |
| `/api/export-import` is LIVE across Knowledge/Config/Tables/Integrations/Maintenance/ImportDialog | **CONFIRMED** | `exportImport.ts:31,59,99,131`; export callers `Knowledge.tsx:295`, `Config.tsx:169`, `Tables.tsx:172`, `Integrations.tsx:135`, `Maintenance.tsx:242`; ImportDialog `:367,380,387`; router registered `main.py:595`, all `CurrentSuperuser` | — |
| `/api/export-import` re-implements secret encryption + org rebinding independently of Solutions (a second copy) | **PARTIAL** | Independence CONFIRMED (own crypto orchestration `export_import.py:729-730,1164-1173`; own org rebind `_resolve_org_id:87`, `_parse_target_org:145`; no cross-imports either way). "Second copy" OVERSTATED: Solutions uses a structurally different secret path (scrypt envelope `secrets_blob.py:9-26`) and different org binding (`Solution.organization_id` `zip_install.py:367,415`); they share only `src.core.security` primitives | **Fix the spec:** these are **parallel re-implementations, not literal copies** — overlapping concern, no shared orchestration |
| Solutions covers tables/configs/integrations but has NO Knowledge equivalent, so `/api/export-import/knowledge` pins the router alive | **CONFIRMED** | Solutions covers Table `capture.py:131`, configs `:136`, integrations `:354/641`; no `KnowledgeStore` anywhere under `services/solutions/` (the only "knowledge" hit is `agent.knowledge_sources` `capture.py:604`, source NAMES not document rows). export_import is unique knowledge path `export_import.py:32,419,168`, live via `Knowledge.tsx:295` | Minor: actual HEAD is `377fd522`, not `9a76c95c` — does not affect the verdict |
| MCP tools write the ORM directly (second create/update impl) for agents/forms/tables/apps, violating the thin-wrapper rule | **CONFIRMED** | Direct ORM `agents.py:322,339,362`, `forms.py:308,314`, `tables.py:288-289`, `apps.py:188,238`; `test_mcp_thin_wrapper.py` only asserts over `PARITY_HANDLERS:51-78` (roles/configs/claims/orgs/integrations/workflow) — agents/forms/tables/apps **deliberately exempt**. MCP path **drops** `sync_agent_roles_to_workflows`/`sync_form_roles_to_workflows` that REST runs (`routers/agents.py:509,838`; `routers/forms.py:417,622`) | — |
| Writing a workflow `.py` via file-write upserts a Workflow row — a FOURTH workflow CREATE mechanism | **REFUTED (create-claim)** | Surface is real (`service.py:450,473` via `POST /api/files/write`), but `indexers/workflow.py` is UPDATE-ONLY: skips unregistered functions `:161-168,281-287`, all mutations are `update(...)`, no `db.add`/`insert(Workflow)` in the file; delete is soft-deactivate `:613-648`. Docstring `:104` "Use register_workflow() to create" | **Fix the spec/critique:** this is an **enrich/update + soft-delete** surface, NOT a fourth create path. It excludes `tool_description` `:187-190` and never overwrites non-NULL name/description `:207-212` |
| `PUT /api/applications/{id}/dependencies` is an untraced Application-row write surface | **CONFIRMED** (relocated) | Route lives in `app_code_files.py:862-908` (not `applications.py`): `app.dependencies = ...` `:901`, `commit` `:902`, solution guard `:880`. Plus draft/publish/swap/rollback `applications.py:485,528,629,897` | Spec's "next-check" looked in `applications.py`; the dependencies route is in `app_code_files.py` |
| CLI is genuinely thin (subsumed by REST) | **CONFIRMED** | `commands/apps.py:6-19` maps every verb to a REST endpoint; `bifrost/files.py:137 → POST /api/files/write`. No independent ORM write path | — |

## Complete inventory of create-vs-update mechanisms

Eight distinct mechanisms span the seven surfaces. The "~5-6" spec estimate undercounts once MCP and file-write are folded in.

| # | Mechanism | Decides create-vs-update by | Surfaces / entities |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **HTTP verb + route** (REST inline-ORM) | POST collection = new `uuid4()`; PUT/PATCH item = load-by-id + mutate | REST routers — Agent (`agents.py:392,699`), Form (`forms.py:379,554`), Workflow update (`workflows.py:1437`) |
| 2 | **Repository upsert/CRUD method** | repo method semantics (set_config UPSERTS by key; others by id) | REST via `ConfigRepository`/`TableRepository`/`ApplicationRepository`/`IntegrationsRepository` |
| 3 | **`SyncOp.Upsert(match_on="id"\|"name")`** | UPDATE WHERE match; rowcount==0 → INSERT (`sync_ops.py:103-115`) | git-sync `_resolve_form/agent/config/app` (`manifest_import.py:2886/2937/2245/2315`); Solutions Workflow/Table/Claim/App/config-schema (`deploy.py:799…`) |
| 4 | **Natural-key two-pass + id-realign (raw Core)** | match by (name/slug, org) → UPDATE+realign id; else by id; else `insert().on_conflict_do_nothing` | git-sync `_resolve_table` (`manifest_import.py:2390-2452`), `_resolve_custom_claim`; Solutions `SolutionConnectionSchema`/`EventSource` (`deploy.py:1489-1510,1566-1578`) |
| 5 | **`insert().on_conflict_do_update` (Postgres UPSERT on PK/constraint)** | INSERT, on id/constraint conflict UPDATE | Indexers `AgentIndexer`/`FormIndexer` (`agent.py:119-148`); git-sync OAuthProvider (`manifest_import.py:2111`) |
| 6 | **In-place ORM attribute-mutation upsert** | `if key in existing: mutate; else insert(...)` | git-sync integration config-schema + mappings (`manifest_import.py:2069-2087,2158-2174`) |
| 7 | **Natural-key direct-ORM `db.add` upsert** (export-import) | natural-key lookup → mutate-existing / `db.add(new)`; gated by `replace_existing` | `/api/export-import` Knowledge/Table/Config/Integration (`export_import.py:545/620/755/835`) |
| 8 | **Direct `db.add` + inline setters** (MCP) | hand-rolled; create tool vs update tool | MCP agents/forms/tables/apps (`mcp_server/tools/agents.py:322`, `forms.py:308`, etc.) |

Notes on the watch/file-write surface: it is **not** a create-vs-update mechanism at all — `WorkflowIndexer.index_python_file` is UPDATE-only and cannot insert. CLI adds no mechanism (delegates to #1/#2 via REST).

## Corrections to the spec

- **`POST /api/files/manifest/import` reason is wrong.** The spec/verdict says github_sync "calls `import_manifest_from_repo` directly." It does not — github_sync imports/instantiates `ManifestResolver` (`github_sync.py:54-56,279`) and uses `_diff_and_collect` (`:1146`). The git-sync path bypasses both the HTTP wrapper and `import_manifest_from_repo`; the two import paths share only the `ManifestResolver` class. The endpoint is genuinely orphaned (no CLI/client caller), but for that reason, not the stated one.
- **File-write/watch is not a fourth workflow CREATE path.** The completeness critique's headline ("writing a workflow `.py` upserts a Workflow ORM row … FOURTH create mechanism") is REFUTED. `indexers/workflow.py` skips any function with no pre-existing registered row (`:161-168,281-287`), performs only `update(...)`, and soft-deactivates on delete (`:613-648`). It is an enrich/update surface bounded to `.py` files via `needs_indexing` (`file_ops.py:215,223,244`).
- **"export_import is a second copy of Solutions' secret/org logic" overstates it.** They are independent parallel re-implementations sharing only `src.core.security` primitives. export_import uses a source-key→dest-key re-encrypt model (`:729-730,1164-1173`) + `_resolve_org_id`/`_parse_target_org`; Solutions uses a scrypt password envelope (`secrets_blob.py`) + install-row `Solution.organization_id`. Overlap is on entity coverage (tables/configs/integrations), not code.
- **The app-dependencies route is mislocated in the spec's next-check.** `PUT /api/applications/{id}/dependencies` is in `app_code_files.py:862-908`, not `applications.py`; a router-file-scoped grep on `applications.py` misses it.
- **MCP write paths are entirely absent from the contract baseline.** The spec asserts "CLI/MCP/manifest all read from the same DTOs," but agents/forms/tables/apps MCP create+update write the ORM directly (`agents.py:322`, `forms.py:308`, `tables.py:288`, `apps.py:188`), are exempt from `test_mcp_thin_wrapper.py` (`PARITY_HANDLERS:51-78`), hand-roll name validation (`agents.py:260,264`), and drop the REST role-sync side-effect. This is a real divergence, not covered by the DTO-parity assumption.
- **HEAD mismatch (cosmetic):** the task framing cites `9a76c95c`; the worktree HEAD is `377fd522`. No verdict is affected.

## Still requires live repro

Two findings are real bugs whose *runtime consequence* cannot be fully settled by code reading alone:

1. **Silent empty-name agent deploy (FK orphan / lying count).** Code confirms `AgentIndexer.index_agent` returns `False` and writes no row on blank name/system_prompt (`agent.py:69-77`), yet deploy then runs `update(Agent).where(id==...)` (0 rows, silent), adds role/MCP junction rows whose FK target may not exist, and `DeployResult.agents_upserted` counts `len(bundle.agents)` regardless (`deploy.py:476`). Whether the junction inserts actually raise a FK violation at COMMIT (vs. silently succeed against a non-existent agent id) depends on DB constraint enforcement at runtime — needs a live deploy of a bundle with a blank-named agent to observe whether it 500s, half-commits, or reports a false-positive count.

2. **`Workflow.tool_description` round-trip loss on capture→deploy.** Code confirms the field is omitted from capture, the manifest model, the importer, and the deploy values dict, while the column exists and is user-settable via the workflow PATCH. The end-user-visible impact — a `type='tool'` workflow's MCP/agent-facing description silently reverting to NULL after a capture-then-redeploy cycle — needs a live capture → install → inspect to confirm the column is actually cleared (vs. left untouched on an update that omits the key).

# 8. LIVE REPRO — both bugs reproduced end-to-end (2026-06-19)

Driven via the API-matched CLI against a fresh netbird dev stack (`bifrost-debug-be6ad6da`),
solution `tooldesc-repro` install `58a5f7ec…`. Not code-reading — observed behavior.

## Bug 1 — `tool_description` dropped on export/capture — CONFIRMED LIVE
- Set `workflows.tool_description = 'CURATED-TOOLDESC-DO-NOT-LOSE-12345'` on the deployed
  solution workflow `hello` (direct DB write, since the API blocks it — see below).
- `bifrost solution export tooldesc-repro --mode shareable` → unzipped bundle.
- The exported `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` carries `type, endpoint_enabled, public_endpoint,
  timeout_seconds, category, tags, access_level, roles` — **but no `tool_description`**.
- `grep -r CURATED-TOOLDESC… bundle/` → **NOT FOUND ANYWHERE**. The curated description is gone
  the moment the solution is exported; any reinstall loses it.
- **Stronger finding (the guard makes it unfixable):** trying to set it the supported way —
  `PATCH /api/workflows/{id} {"tool_description": …}` on a solution-managed workflow — returns
  `403 "Solution-managed entities can only be managed by deployment methods."` So for a
  solution tool: the API path is **blocked by the read-only guard**, and the deployment path
  **doesn't carry the field**. There is **no supported path** to give a solution's tool a
  curated description. (Only a `_repo`/global workflow can have one — and capture drops it.)

## Bug 2 — blank-name agent silently swallowed + lying success count — CONFIRMED LIVE
- Added an agent with `name: ''` + a `tool_ids` binding to `.bifrost/agents.yaml`, deployed.
- CLI printed `found … 1 agent(s)` and `Deploy complete.` with **no error**.
- DB after: **0 agents**, **0 orphan agent_tools**. The agent never materialized —
  `AgentIndexer.index_agent` hit `if not name: return False` (`agent.py:69-72`) and no-op'd.
- The deploy job result row (`c1ffaaf9…`) recorded `"status":"succeeded"` and
  **`"agents_upserted": 1`** — a **false-positive count**: it claims it upserted an agent that
  does not exist. No 500, no surfaced warning. Worst-case diagnostic: a solution author ships a
  package, sees green, and the agent is silently missing on every install.

Both bugs are structural consequences of the manifest/indexer path NOT going through the REST
contract (which would 422 the blank name and carry `tool_description`). This is the empirical
backing for the §6 unification work.

# 9. DEAD-CODE REMOVAL MANIFEST (verified 2026-06-19)

Per Jack: "anything dead should be removed." Each item below has been verified to have NO live
(non-test) caller. Tests-only ≠ live. This is a removal work-list for the plan.

## 9.1 Confirmed DEAD — remove

| Item | file:line | Proof of death | Tests to delete/rewrite |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/files/manifest/import` endpoint | `routers/files.py:457-511` | No client fetch (only generated `v1.d.ts`), no CLI caller; last production caller (CLI watch manifest-push) was **deliberately removed** — `test_watch_regression_disappearing_entity.py` asserts it must never be called again | `test_cli_push_pull.py` (the two POST tests), regression test's assertion stays valid |
| `ManifestImportRequest` class | `routers/files.py:427-454` | Type for the dead handler only; no other use | — |
| `ManifestImportResponse` contract + exports | `models/contracts/files.py` + `__init__.py:297,1031` | No CLI/client/SDK consumer; only the dead endpoint returns it | — |
| `import_manifest_from_repo()` | `manifest_import.py:524-736` | Only caller is the dead endpoint (`files.py:493`). NOT used by git-sync (uses `ManifestResolver` directly) or Solutions | `test_manifest_import.py`, `test_manifest_import_config_cache.py` (both drive this fn directly — delete or re-point at `ManifestResolver`) |
| `_apply_role_name_resolution()` | `manifest_import.py:414-466` | Called only from `import_manifest_from_repo:604` | (via above) |
| `_rewrite_org_ids()` | `manifest_import.py:468-510` | Called only from `import_manifest_from_repo:609` | (via above) |

## 9.2 MUST PRESERVE — shared with live git-sync / Solutions (do NOT delete)

`ManifestResolver` (used by `github_sync.py:279`), `_diff_and_collect` + its diff helpers (used
by `github_sync.py:1162`), `_form/_agent_content_from_manifest`, `_resolve_*_content`,
`_resolve_role_names` (used by `solutions/deploy.py:627`), `generate_manifest` +
`GET /api/files/manifest` (live: git-sync state export + app tests), all `_resolve_*` methods.
These are the logic the dead `import_manifest_from_repo` *also* touched — removal must extract
the dead wrapper while leaving these intact.

## 9.3 Test impact

`test_manifest_import.py` and `test_manifest_import_config_cache.py` exist solely to exercise
`import_manifest_from_repo` in isolation (no git). When the function goes, these either delete
(the `_resolve_*` logic they cover is already covered by git-sync e2e + the Solutions deploy
e2e) or get re-pointed at `ManifestResolver`. Decide per-test during the plan — do not blindly
delete coverage of `_resolve_*` without confirming git-sync/Solutions e2e covers the same paths.

## 9.4 Already-dead (no action — confirmed removed upstream)

`bifrost export` / `bifrost import` CLI commands, `api/bifrost/portable.py` — gone from the tree
(§2.1). No orphaned `cli.py` dispatch branches remain.

# 10. CONSOLIDATION GOAL + entity-coverage delta (2026-06-19)

**Revised north star (Jack):** the end state is **Solutions as the single export/import/backup
system**. The old manifest portable format and `/api/export-import` get cleared away once
Solutions covers what users actually need — leaving an *ultra-clean foundation* BEFORE we
centralize writes onto the single write-service (§6.1). So dead-code removal (§9) is step one,
but the real question is the **capability delta**: the old format supported entities Solutions
does not, and we must not delete a format that's carrying a capability Solutions lacks.

## 10.1 Coverage buckets (full matrix verified — see audit)

**A. Old manifest/export-import carried it, Solutions does NOT — but it SHOULDN'T be portable
(safe to drop with the old format):**
- Organizations, Users, User-Role assignments — platform identity, never belongs in a package.
- Role *definitions* — Solutions binds roles per-entity but doesn't author role rows. Identity.
- MCP servers / connections / connection-tools — per-org platform bindings + vendor secrets.
- Integration *mappings* + OAuth *provider client secrets* — env/secret-bearing.
- These were in the manifest only because git-sync is a whole-env MIRROR, not a portable
  package. Solutions correctly omits them. Dropping the manifest format does not lose a
  *packaging* capability here.

**B. Real CONTENT gaps that block "Solutions = the one system" (Solutions must absorb these, or
we knowingly accept the loss before deleting the old path):**
| Gap | Who has it today | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge stores (RAG)** | `/api/export-import/knowledge` ONLY (`export_import.py:165-191,420`) | A RAG solution can't package its knowledge; nothing in manifest OR Solutions carries it | HIGH |
| **Config VALUES** | manifest + export-import carry values; Solutions = schema-only (`capture.py:296`, `deploy.py:1340`) | Solutions can't ship default/seed config values; backup can't restore a config snapshot | MED |
| **Table DATA (rows)** | export-import carries `Document` rows; Solutions capture has `include_data` but deploy never writes rows (`deploy.py:806`) | Operator BACKUP/restore of operational data has no Solutions equivalent | MED (backup), LOW (packaging) |

**C. Solutions does things the old formats never did (the reason it's the right base):**
inline Python source bundling, solution metadata (version/logo/readme), config-schema
declarations, connection declarations, per-install id remap + ownership/scope guards, SVG logo
sanitization.

## 10.2 The decisions this forces (Jack's call — see §10.3)

Consolidation can't be "just delete the old format" until we resolve, per gap in bucket B:
absorb into Solutions, OR keep a narrow backup tool, OR accept the capability loss. These are
product decisions, captured in §10.3 once answered. Bucket A drops cleanly with the old format.

# 11. Refinement (Jack, 2026-06-19): shared export/import CORE, not "delete export-import"

Jack's correction to §10: the **UI-supported** import/export features (Solutions' and Tables')
are real user features, a different category from the dead backend plumbing in §9 — they are
NOT deletion targets. The actual goal is **don't maintain two backup tools**: where Solutions
and the standalone per-entity export/import *overlap*, they must share ONE underlying structure,
so that when Solutions gains a capability (knowledge, etc.) there's a common core to extend, not
a third parallel copy.

## 11.1 The duplication, concretely (Tables — Jack's example)

Tables is exported/imported in **two independent implementations today**:
- `/api/export-import`: `_build_tables_export` → `TableExportItem` + `DocumentExportItem` (rows),
  with its own import-side org-rebind + decode (`export_import.py:449,595`).
- Solutions `capture.py`: `_table_entries` (schema + `policies`, `:455-465`) + `_table_data`
  (rows via `include_data`, `:363`) → solution bundle structure + `secrets.enc`.

Two field mappings, two row-data formats, two decoders, for the SAME entity. The §7 audit
already found these share only `src.core.security` primitives. Adding knowledge/configs later
under today's pattern would mean a THIRD copy each.

## 11.2 Principle: one entity serialize/deserialize core; envelopes stay distinct

Mirror of the write-side decision (§6.1). For each entity, ONE
`EntitySerializer.{to_portable, from_portable}` owns: field set, secret handling, row-data
handling, org/identity rebind on import. Both consumers call it:
- **Solutions** packaging (capture→bundle, deploy/install→DB) wraps it in the solution zip +
  `secrets.enc` envelope + per-install remap/guards.
- **Standalone UI backup** (`/api/export-import`, the Tables/Config/etc. buttons) wraps it in the
  operator JSON/ZIP envelope.

What stays distinct (correctly): the **envelope** (solution zip vs operator JSON/ZIP), the
**trigger** (solution capture vs a per-entity UI button), and Solutions' install-time
remap/ownership/scope. What gets shared: the per-entity *structure* underneath. Result — a Tables
change is made once; Solutions gaining knowledge = add one serializer both paths use; no second
backup tool to maintain.

This pairs with §6.1: **writes** centralize on one `EntityWriter`; **export/import**
centralizes on one `EntitySerializer`. Same "everyone calls the same stuff" principle, both
directions. (The `from_portable` import path is the natural producer of the validated
`content_dto` that `EntityWriter.upsert` consumes — the two cores meet there.)

## 11.3 Status of the §10.3 product decisions
DEFERRED, not decided — Jack dismissed the four questions in favor of the §11 framing. Knowledge
absorption, config-values/table-data backup story, and bucket-A drop are still open and will be
revisited once the shared-core structure exists (which is the point: decide capability scope
against a common structure, not against two divergent ones). The Phase-1 sequencing question is
also still open and gates plan-writing.
